# Expand_by_2_pulse
Whenever clock edge will detect a logic high input data, it will generate 2 extra pulses along with that pulse after the next clock edge. If back to back pulses will detect then it will generate 6 pulses. If in between the pulse generation new pulse will come at the input data then also it can produce pulses for the incoming pulse.
